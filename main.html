              <p class="aboutp">The Space Biology Engine, an innovative platform, is the humble creation of a highly committed individual. With a passion for technology and an aspiration to become a professional programmer, the creator channeled their expertise into a tool that merges their love for coding with the fascinating domain of space science.
                <br>
                The long-term goal of the Engine is to be a one-stop-shop information repository for the field. Within its digital context, you can expect comprehensive treatment of virtually every single topic related to space biology, from the effects of microgravity on cellular structure to the challenges of sustaining life in other planetary environments.
                <br>
                This project is more than a school assignment; it is a testament to the talent and commitment of its teen designer, representing the most sophisticated and detailed space biology device ever created by a high school student today.
