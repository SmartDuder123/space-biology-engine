        Spaceflight poses a risk of adverse health effects due to the
        interactions between microorganisms, their hosts, and their environment.
        The JSC Microbiology team addresses the benefits and risks related to
        microorganisms, including infectious disease, allergens, environmental
        and food contamination, and the impacts of changes in environmental and
        human microbial ecology aboard spacecraft. The team includes certified
        medical technologists, environmental microbiologists, mycologists, and
        biosafety professionals.

        The JSC Microbiology laboratory, a Biosafety Level 2 facility, is a
        critical component of the Human Health and Performance Directorate and
        is responsible for addressing crew health and environmental issues
        related to microbial infection, allergens, and contamination. This
        responsibility is achieved by operational monitoring and investigative
        research using classical microbiological, advanced molecular, and
        immunohistochemical techniques. This research has resulted in a
        significant number of presentations and peer-reviewed publications
        contributing to the field of Microbiology with articles in journals such
        as Infection and Immunity, Journal of Infectious Disease and Applied and
        Environmental Microbiology, Nature Reviews Microbiology, and Proceedings
        of the National Academies of Science.

        As a functional part of the Crew Health Care System and in support of
        Environmental Control and Life Support Systems engineers, the
        Microbiology Laboratory team defines requirements, coordinates and
        analyzes microbial sampling, and analysis of air, surface, and water
        samples. These environmental samples, including preflight and in-flight
        samples, re-analyzed to ensure that microorganisms do not adversely
        affect crew health or system performance. Microbiologists also serve as
        team members when anomalous events occur that might affect crew health
        or life support systems operations. Spaceflight food samples also are
        evaluated preflight to decrease the risk of infectious disease to the
        crew.

        The mission of the Biosafety Review Board (BRB) is to identify, evaluate, control, and prevent biological hazards in conformance with NASA, federal, and international health and safety regulations. The BRB includes a team of microbiologists, cell biologists, physicians, industrial hygienists, and occupational health professionals to assess the wide range of biohazardous materials encountered. Biohazardous materials may consist of bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoa, cell cultures, and other infectious agents. All biological payloads are assessed, and biohazardous materials identified are assigned a NASA biosafety level. Additional functions of the BRB include evaluating ground-based experiments using biohazardous materials, maintaining a current inventory of biohazardous materials stored at JSC facilities, and conducting an annual inspection of JSC facilities using biohazardous materials.
