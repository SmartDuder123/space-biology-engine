        Through isolation, astronauts are well protected from infection while
        aboard the International Space Station. However, COVID-19 still affected
        station research activities. In addition to conducting studies aimed at
        ensuring the safety of the crew, researchers used the microgravity lab
        to contribute to the fight against the virus.
        <br />
        <br />
        One experiment launched to the space station in December 2020 examined
        the efficiency of remdesivir, an intravenous antiviral drug currently
        approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of
        COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. Using a commercially owned and
        operated research facility, Europe’s International Commercial Experiment
        Cubes (ICE Cubes), researchers from ESA (European Space Agency) tested
        the drug’s behavior in microgravity with the goal of increasing its
        efficiency. Scientists studied the physical and chemical behaviors of
        the drug and how it interacts with a delivery substance, cyclodextrin,
        that makes remdesivir soluble in water. Soluble drugs can be dissolved
        into a solution and administered via IV and, once administered, move
        more easily through the patient’s bloodstream.
        <br />
        <br />
        Studying the interactions between remdesivir and cyclodextrin in
        microgravity could allow researchers to enhance the ratio of the drug to
        cyclodextrin. Decreasing the amount of cyclodextrin in the IV bag
        reduces the risk to coronavirus-infected patients with pre-existing
        kidney problems.
        <br />
        <br />
        Scientists leading another experiment already scheduled to be conducted
        aboard the station as the COVID-19 pandemic began expanded their
        analysis to contribute to COVID-19 research. Antimicrobial Coatings
        studied how effectively certain antimicrobial coatings could limit the
        growth and spread of pathogenic microbes on frequently touched surfaces.
        The study tested the coating on several materials representing
        high-touch surfaces in aircraft and spacecraft, such as tray tables,
        seat fabric, and belt buckles.
      </p>
      <p class="text3">
        During a 6-month period, crew members touched the samples every few days
        to encourage microbial growth. At the end of the experiment, the samples
        returned to a lab on Earth for analysis. This research was originally
        intended for use on space missions, but as the COVID-19 virus spread,
        scientists adapted the research to also test effectiveness in preventing
        the spread of viruses on surfaces as well.
        <br />
        <br />
        Additionally, several companies have demonstrated that their air-quality
        technologies developed for the space station could reduce the spread of
        COVID-19. A technology tested for detecting contaminants on the space
        station went on to be included in an air sensor used on Earth to
        generate a virus propagation risk index in shared spaces, letting people
        know to reduce crowding or take other steps to limit risk.
