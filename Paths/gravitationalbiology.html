        Gravitational biology is the study of the effects gravity has on living
        organisms. Throughout the history of the Earth life has evolved to
        survive changing conditions, such as changes in the climate and habitat.
        However, one constant factor in evolution since life first began on
        Earth is the force of gravity. As a consequence, all biological
        processes are accustomed to the ever-present force of gravity and even
        small variations in this force can have significant impact on the health
        and function and the system of organisms.

        Cell and molecular biology research cuts across all science disciplines
        in Space Biology, from understanding how single-celled organisms, such
        as protozoa, bacteria, and fungi respond to the conditions of
        spaceflight, to how all of the various cells in a complex tissue or
        organ work together to help an organism as a whole acclimate to such a
        foreign environment. The overarching goal of Space Biology Cell and
        Molecular Biology research at NASA is to determine how the stresses of
        the spaceflight environment affect living systems at the basic cellular
        and molecular levels, using contemporary cell and molecular biology
        techniques and measures. This includes characterizing and identifying
        changes in gene and protein expression, DNA function and structure,
        cellular structure and morphology, and cell-to-cell communication.

        Altered gravity is a unique feature of the physical environment of
        space: reduced gravity on the surfaces of the Moon and Mars, and
        microgravity in orbit. Most microbes are too small to sense the force of
        gravity directly, but one way they may experience its effects is through
        its influence on their fluid environment. On Earth, gravity drives fluid
        mixing via density-driven convection; less gravity means less convective
        mixing. Everywhere microbes are found, they tend to live in multispecies
        communities, and commonly depend on chemical exchange through their
        environments to communicate and/or share resources. We are studying the
        potential effects of microgravity on multispecies communities using
        rotating wall vessels (RWVs) in the lab and are particularly interested
        in understanding the fidelity of microgravity simulation and the effects
        of experimental parameters such as rotation rate on that fidelity. We
        are also collaborating with the Computational Materials Group to build a
        simulation of the physical, biological, and chemical interactions of
        microorganisms in liquid culture in space, called CAMDLES: computational
        simulation of microbial populations in spaceflight (read about an early
        version of this model here.) This work has been funded by a grant from
        the NASA Space Biology Program and the Ames Center Innovation Fund.

        Space radiation comes in many different flavors. Charged-particle
        radiation in the form of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) and Solar Particle
        Events (SPE) pose a substantial health risk to organisms traveling
        beyond Low Earth Orbit. However, for a tiny microbial cell, getting hit
        by a radiation particle can actually be a relatively rare event. What
        does this mean for our understanding of the effects of radiation on
        microbes, and how does that differ from what we know about radiation
        effects on multicellular organisms? Studying radiation from the
        perspective of individual microbial cells has implications not only for
        our ability to design microbial bioproduction systems to sustain human
        life in deep space, but also for our ability to interpret spaceflight
        radiobiology experiments using microbes as model organisms.

        We are using diverse wet-lab methods to study single-cell radiation
        effects in yeast, including a collaboration with the Di Carlo Lab at
        UCLA to encapsulate yeast cells in hydrogel particles to facilitate
        lineage tracking. We have also developed a computational model to
        simulate yeast population growth in the presence of radiation, called
        AMMPER: Agent-based Model of Microbial Populations Exposed to Radiation
        (open-source and available at NASA GitHub). This work has been supported
        by MUREP, Space Grant, and the Ames Research Innovation Award.

        Adaptive evolution plays a major role in the appearance of new
        phenotypes in nature and is of key importance in biomedical research,
        including the onset of carcinogenesis and in the emergence of
        drug-resistant microorganisms. The harsh environment of space provides
        the ideal environment for the acquisition of adaptive mutations,
        particularly in microbial organisms. Experimental evolution studies in
        the laboratory allow us to better understand how specific mutations
        arise under spaceflight conditions. Our primary goal is to investigate
        how a eukaryotic organism responds to simulated microgravity after
        multiple generations. S. cerevisiae or budding yeast is a single-cell
        model eukaryote that has been widely used in biomedical research,
        primarily due to its well-characterized biology, easy manipulation,
        short division time, and, most importantly, its similarities with human
        cell functions. We hypothesize that beneficial mutations acquired
        through multiple generations under simulated microgravity will render
        cells with increased growth and/or metabolic rates, and phenotypes
        different to those observed in 1g controls. Studies like the one
        proposed here will allow us to identify beneficial mutations responsible
        for an adaptive response to space-like conditions. This project is a
        collaboration with the Sherlock Lab at Stanford University. Dr.
        Sherlockâ€™s team has developed barcoded yeast libraries, and the
        different DNA manipulation and next-generation sequencing approaches
        that are being used in this study. Once completed, all project data will
        be archived in the NASA GeneLab repository. This project has been funded
        by a grant from the NASA Space Biology program to Principal Investigator
        Sergio Santa Maria.
