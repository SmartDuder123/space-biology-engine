        A NASA-sponsored team has developed a discovery environment that enables
        researchers to explore information on radiation exposure from numerous
        spaceflight experiments and extend our understanding of how radiation
        affects life forms in space.

        Spaceflight significantly increases exposure to ionizing radiation,
        creating an environment that is not only detrimental to plant and animal
        life, but one that is much different from that commonly experienced on
        Earth. Mitigating the effects of radiation exposure represents a
        critical challenge for future spaceflight missions. Thus, understanding
        the effects the crew and other onboard organisms will experience during
        spaceflight is a crucial area of research. Numerous experiments have
        exposed different organisms to a wide range of space radiation
        environments. However, data on the precise characteristics of the
        investigation and especially on the radiation exposure experienced is
        often complex to access and understand, even for experts in the field of
        radiation biology.
        <br />
        <br />
        A NASA-sponsored research team at the University of Wisconsin has
        developed the Rad-Bio-App database to help all levels of
        researchers—from experts to interested citizen scientists—explore space
        biology-related radiation data. Rad-Bio-App is an interactive,
        relational database that links previously conducted space biology
        experiments according to the level and type of radiation exposure. It
        also links experiments sharing other common features such as the
        organism studied or mission hardware used. Rad-Bio-App enables the user
        to filter through this web of relationships and easily “drill down” into
        the results from studies with similar radiation environments or
        features. This ability to interactively sort and filter allows
        researchers to significantly extend the insights drawn from existing
        results and adds value to the considerable investments already made in
        conducting these experiments.

        But where does the data fueling Rad-Bio-App come from? Regular access to
        space has allowed researchers to explore how this environment impacts
        biological systems, including crew, animals, plants, and microbes that
        accompany them. NASA’s GeneLab data repository has aggregated results
        from many of these studies, including descriptions of their radiation
        environments. Our team has capitalized on this resource to develop
        Rad-Bio-App as a graphical discovery environment. We imported the
        GeneLab-curated data from missions on the International Space Station,
        the Space Shuttle, and free-flying satellites such as the Russian Bion
        and Foton spacecraft. In addition, we added results from a variety of
        experiments using terrestrial radiation sources such as particle
        accelerators.
        <br />
        <br />
        To help provide context for future missions, we also gathered the
        radiation exposure data from the Mars Curiosity Rover mission while it
        traveled to Mars and after it landed on the planet’s surface. For the
        Moon, we used radiation data from the Apollo astronaut’s radiation
        monitors, recent robotic explorers, and the Lunar Reconnaissance
        Orbiter. The Moon and Mars data will enable researchers to place each
        study in the context of the predicted radiation environment of future
        missions beyond Low Earth Orbit.
        <br />
        <br />
        Rad-Bio-App allows users to interactively filter experiments according
        to their radiation exposure and many other elements of the experimental
        design. Thus, Rad-Bio-App can be used to explore radiation responses
        determined by previous spaceflight experiments and help put these
        experiments in the context of radiation exposures likely to be
        encountered in future exploration missions. For example, this tool was
        used to identify datasets within the GeneLab data repository where mice
        had experienced similar radiation doses to those expected during a
        flight from Earth to Mars. These datasets contained analyses of the
        patterns of gene expression (see figure a, below). Each individual study
        provides some insight into possible genetic changes in the spaceflight
        environment. Moreover, Rad-Bio-App allowed researchers to analyze
        patterns of altered gene expression across multiple studies selected for
        their common Earth-to-Mars-like radiation exposure and shared focus on
        responses in the mouse. Such cross-study analyses identified clusters of
        genes related to different biological functions that are seen across
        multiple samples (see figure b). These gene clusters provide targets for
        further research into how biology might respond to the radiation dosage
        experienced while traveling from Earth to Mars, and represent new
        targets for potential countermeasures to mitigate the harmful effects of
        radiation exposure.
        <br />
        <br />
        Rad-Bio-App provides critical contextual information on radiation that
        enables researchers to extend the analysis of existing space biology
        datasets. The database architecture of Rad-Bio-App is designed to
        continuously incorporate the wealth and diversity of future space
        biology studies. Thus, this tool should help provide an ever-expanding
        insight into how life forms are affected by the complex and varied space
        radiation environment.

        (a) Genes affected in spaceflight seen in multiple mouse RNAseq datasets
        identified as experiencing radiation similar to that during Martian
        transit (GeneLab Data Sets 243, 244, 246, 247, 248) were
        cross-referenced to genes annotated as being radiation responsive. These
        were then displayed as a heatmap that shows how genes were more or less
        active in the spaceflight samples. (b) These genes were then grouped by
        their predicted biological functions, providing insight into the
        cellular processes that are likely being affected by the
        Earth-to-Mars-like radiation exposure. Reproduced from Barker et al.,
