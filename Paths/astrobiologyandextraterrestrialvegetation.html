        As humans explore space, we will want to bring plants for both aesthetic
        and practical reasons. We already know from our pioneering astronauts
        that fresh flowers and gardens on the International Space Station create
        a beautiful atmosphere and let us take a little piece of Earth with us
        on our journeys. They’re good for our psychological well-being on Earth
        and in space. They also will be critical for keeping astronauts healthy
        on long-duration missions.
        <br />
        <br />
        A lack of vitamin C was all it took to give sailors scurvy, and vitamin
        deficiencies can cause a number of other health problems. Simply packing
        some multi-vitamins will not be enough to keep astronauts healthy as
        they explore deep space. They will need fresh produce.
        <br />
        <br />
        Right now on the space station, astronauts receive regular shipments of
        a wide variety of freeze-dried and prepackaged meals to cover their
        dietary needs – resupply missions keep them freshly stocked. When crews
        venture further into space, traveling for months or years without
        resupply shipments, the vitamins in prepackaged form break down over
        time, which presents a problem for astronaut health.
        <br />
        <br />
        NASA is looking at ways to provide astronauts with nutrients in a
        long-lasting, easily absorbed form—freshly grown fresh fruits and
        vegetables. The challenge is how to do that in a closed environment
        without sunlight or Earth’s gravity.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Vegetable Production System, known as Veggie, is a space garden
        residing on the space station. Veggie’s purpose is to help NASA study
        plant growth in microgravity, while adding fresh food to the astronauts’
        diet and enhancing happiness and well-being on the orbiting laboratory.
        The Veggie garden is about the size of a carry-on piece of luggage and
        typically holds six plants. Each plant grows in a “pillow” filled with a
        clay-based growth media and fertilizer. The pillows are important to
        help distribute water, nutrients and air in a healthy balance around the
        roots. Otherwise, the roots would either drown in water or be engulfed
        by air because of the way fluids in space tend to form bubbles.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the absence of gravity, plants use other environmental factors, such
        as light, to orient and guide growth. A bank of light emitting diodes
        (LEDs) above the plants produces a spectrum of light suited for the
        plants’ growth. Since plants reflect a lot of green light and use more
        red and blue wavelengths, the Veggie chamber typically glows magenta
        pink.
        <br />
        <br />
        To date, Veggie has successfully grown a variety of plants, including
        three types of lettuce, Chinese cabbage, mizuna mustard, red Russian
        kale and zinnia flowers. The flowers were especially popular with
        astronaut Scott Kelly, who picked a bouquet and photographed it floating
        in the cupola against the backdrop of Earth. Some of the plants were
        harvested and eaten by the crew members, with remaining samples returned
        to Earth to be analyzed. One concern was harmful microbes growing on the
        produce. So far, no harmful contamination has been detected, and the
        food has been safe (and enjoyable) for the crew to eat.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our team at Kennedy Space Center envisions planting more produce in the
        future, such as tomatoes and peppers. Foods like berries, certain beans
        and other antioxidant-rich foods would have the added benefit of
        providing some space radiation protection for crew members who eat them.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Advanced Plant Habitat (APH), like Veggie, is a growth chamber on
        station for plant research. It uses LED lights and a porous clay
        substrate with controlled release fertilizer to deliver water, nutrients
        and oxygen to the plant roots.
        <br />
        <br />
        But unlike Veggie, it is enclosed and automated with cameras and more
        than 180 sensors that are in constant interactive contact with a team on
        the ground at Kennedy, so it doesn’t need much day-to-day care from the
        crew. Its water recovery and distribution, atmosphere content, moisture
        levels and temperature are all automated. It has more colors of LED
        lights than Veggie, with red, green, and blue lights, but also white,
        far red and even infrared to allow for nighttime imaging.
        <br />
        <br />
        When a harvest is ready for research studies, the crew collects samples
        from the plants, freezes or chemically fixes them to preserve them, and
        sends them back down to Earth to be studied so scientists can better
        understand how space affected their growth and development.
        <br />
        <br />
        APH had its first test run on the space station in Spring 2018 using
        Arabidopsis thaliana (the “white mouse of the plant research world”) and
        dwarf wheat. The time-lapse video of this was a popular social media
        release from the space station worldwide.
        <br />
        <br />
        Dr. Norman Lewis is the principal investigator for the Arabidopsis
        Gravitational Response Omics (Arabidopsis-GRO) consortium study, which
        will be the first study using APH. He and his collaborators are
        especially interested in what happens to plants in space at the gene,
        protein and metabolite level, and what changes occur and why.
        <br />
        <br />
        A key question they want to answer is the relationship between
        microgravity and plant lignin content. Lignins in plants have functions
        whose closest analogy is that of bones in humans. They give structure
        and rigidity to plants and the means to stand upright against gravity.
        We already know space causes bone and muscle loss in humans because the
        physical demands are lower in space. So what about lignins?
        <br />
        <br />
        Lewis and his team also want to know if plants genetically engineered to
        have less lignin can survive and function normally in space. This could
        give space-grown plants several advantages, including being better for
        nutrient absorption when humans eat them and in making plant waste
        easier for composting. Lewis and his team believe this fundamental
        science information will guide our strategies for deep space exploration
        and colonization.
        <br />
        <br />
        Lewis knows space science has come a long way already — and that the
        possibilities on the horizon were previously the world of fiction!
        <br />
        <br />
        The Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) is a facility used to study
        the effects of space on organisms small enough to grow in petri dishes,
        such as yeast and microbes. BRIC-LED is the latest version, which added
        light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to support biology such as plants, mosses,
        algae and cyanobacteria that need light to make their food.
        <br />
        <br />
        Right now, BRIC-LED is undergoing hardware validation tests. Scientists
        want to ensure the LEDs don’t get too hot for the plants and do other
        system checks. Soon, researchers such as Dr. Simon Gilroy of the
        University of Wisconsin-Madison will use it to conduct studies.
        <br />
        <br />
        Gilroy is interested in how the Arabidopsis plant’s gene expression
        changes in space. “There are literally thousands of experiments done on
        Earth [on Arabidopsis],” Gilroy explains. “Cold shock. Touched them. Not
        watered them. Too much water. Shouted at them,” he says with a chuckle.
        “Those databases are all available to us. So we look and see if there
        are any patterns anyone has found and what on the ground mimics what
        happens in space.”
        <br />
        <br />
        Some patterns that arise are expected, like when the genes associated
        with gravity become altered. But two patterns that have caught Gilroy’s
        attention have to do with the plants’ immune system.
        <br />
        <br />
        The plants seem to have increased stress from oxidation. Normal
        chemistry in the cells makes a very reactive oxygen-based chemical.
        Uncontrolled, this “reactive oxygen species” can react with the
        machinery that repairs DNA and mess that up, or it can damage
        mitochondria. In a healthy plant, the cells have ways of dealing with
        it. But in space, plants are making more of it.
        <br />
        <br />
        The other pattern is certain genes associated with the immune system
        turn on and others switch off in space. Scientists suspect this may
        compromise that plants’ ability to fight off infections.
        <br />
        <br />
        There is anecdotal evidence, too, that plants in space may be struggling
        to fend off pathogens. Once, the zinnias in Veggie got a little
        overwatered, and there was a lack of air flow. A fungus started growing
        on the plants, and some died. Astronaut Scott Kelly delicately cleaned
        off the fungus, nursed the surviving plants back to health and got them
        to flower. It could have been a fluke, but it raised the question if
        space was weakening the zinnia’s health.
        <br />
        <br />
        Rather than intentionally making Veggie plants sick to test this theory,
        scientists want to run gene expression studies using BRIC-LED and trick
        plants into thinking they’re being threatened. They do this by
        manipulating protein receptors on the plants, which are constantly on
        the lookout for signs of bacteria.
        <br />
        <br />
        Bacteria use a whip-like structure called a flagellum to help them swim,
        and flagella all share a common set of 22 amino acids nicknamed
        “flag-22.” Plants are looking for flag-22, and their defense systems
        kick on as soon as they pick up on it. Scientists can squirt a harmless
        solution of flag-22 onto the plants. “The plant freaks out and thinks
        it’s being attacked,” Gilroy explains.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the BRIC-LED experiment, tiny plants are grown for 10 days, and then
        scientists squirt them with flag-22. An hour later, the plants are fully
        defending themselves, and scientists douse them with a chemical fixative
        to stop all biological processes. This fixative does a great job of
        preserving the plants’ response state, but as an added step, the plants
        are put into a deep freeze. The plants are later sent back down to Earth
        and ground up to have their RNA extracted and analyzed.
        <br />
        <br />
        Gilroy hopes to learn more about the effects of space on a plant’s
        health this way. “The patterns will tell us whether the plant defense
        system is operating correctly or not,” he says.
        <br />
        <br />
        Research like this will help NASA understand how to keep plants
        flourishing in space and better enable long-duration missions.
