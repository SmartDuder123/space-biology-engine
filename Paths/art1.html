        From the creation of traditional tools like pickaxes and hammers to
        modern miniaturized electronics, civilization has always been dependent
        on mining, or extracting, metals from the Earth. Conventional mining
        methods relied on heavy machinery, fire, and human labor. However,
        scientists have learned to harness the natural power of microbes to
        help. This process, called biomining, is used on Earth as a more
        environmentally friendly and cost-efficient way of obtaining these
        necessary metals. The same process could make it possible to extract
        valuable elements from asteroids and allow astronauts to biomine
        materials they need on missions to the Moon and Mars.

        “Chemical methods of remediation can be very damaging, whereas
        bioremediation and bioleaching is environmentally friendly, and produces
        fewer toxins,” said Charles Cockell, Biorock principal investigator and
        professor at the UK Centre for Astrobiology at the University of
        Edinburgh. “It is low energy demand: you give the microbes some food,
        and they go about their business of mining.”

        While biomining has been used on Earth to address problems of pollution
        such as acid mine drainage, metal extraction in space may be more
        complicated, as microgravity could alter basic physical properties such
        as convection and liquid mixing, and potentially could change how
        microbes attach to surfaces or form the biofilms necessary for the
        extraction process. In 2019, the ESA (European Space Agency) Biorock
        investigation conducted aboard the International Space Station
        demonstrated that microbes can extract elements from basalt, a common
        rock on the Moon and Mars. A follow-on ESA investigation, BioAsteroid,
        took it a step further and tested biomining on actual asteroid material.
        The team showed that not only is it possible for microbes to mine
        elements in space, but some microbes may even perform their task better
        under microgravity conditions. According to Cockell, this shows that it
        may be possible to perform biomining in space, including collecting rare
        elements from asteroids. The next step involves biomining in space on a
        larger scale.

        “Right now, the bioreactors are very small. When we are using these
        bioreactors on a larger industrial scale, what would the effectiveness
        be on the surface of an asteroid?” said Cockell. “These results will
        help us better understand the mechanisms behind biomining and develop
        useful technology for Earth.”
