        To most people, fruit flies are just pests that hover around over-ripe
        bananas and other forgotten fruit. However, to scientists, fruit flies
        are an important model organism, and understanding what goes on within
        these tiny bugs can reveal big things about the basics of biology. NASA
        is studying fruit flies in space to help address the effects of
        long-duration space missions on an astronaut’s body and the way the body
        responds to new and stressful environments.
        <br />
        <br />
        Fruit fly systems are simpler than mammals’, but there are important
        structural, functional and genetic components that are similar between
        the two. Approximately 75% of human disease genes have similar genes in
        the fruit fly, so studying them can help us understand human biology,
        too. Experiments taking place in the reduced-gravity of the
        International Space Station have already increased understanding of the
        human immune system and heart function, for example.

        Fruit flies are well suited for space biology research because
        maintaining a large population requires few resources and little
        equipment. Also, their short life cycle allows scientists to study
        several generations in a single month. To help meet the need for fruit
        fly research conducted in the unique conditions of space, the Space
        Biosciences division at NASA’s Ames Research Center, in California’s
        Silicon Valley, developed the hardware and protocols necessary for
        scientists to send their fruit fly experiments to the space station.

        Fruit Fly Lab-01 (FFL-01)
        <br />
        The Fruit Fly Lab-01 mission marked the first flight of a new research
        platform for long-duration experiments aboard the International Space
        Station. The Fruit Fly Lab system provided long-term housing for fruit
        flies, also known as Drosophila melanogaster, aboard the space station,
        under conditions of microgravity and simulated Earth gravity. The FFL-01
        mission studied the effects of spaceflight on the immune response to
        infection and also served as a test of the new hardware’s performance.
        The FFL-01 mission launched to the space station in January 2015.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fruit Fly Lab-02 mission (FFL-02) was the second experiment to use
        NASA’s Fruit Fly Lab hardware system aboard the International Space
        Station. This study explored the effects of spaceflight on cardiac
        disease and function. FFL-02 used the Vented Fly Box hardware to send
        flies to the space station, where they lived and reproduced in the space
        environment. This experiment included both healthy flies and flies that
        are genetically predisposed to heart dysfunctions. The flies grew and
        developed in space for the duration of the mission, then were sent back
        to Earth for further study. Findings from the FFL-02 mission will
        provide insight into the effects of spaceflight on the cardiovascular
        system. The mission launched to the space station in June 2017.
        <br />
        <br />
        Fruit Fly Lab-03 (FFL-03)
        <br />
        The common fruit fly has a complex immune system that can serve as a
        model for understanding how well the human immune system functions in
        space. The spaceflight environment is known to affect the interaction
        between disease-causing microorganisms, or pathogens, and the people or
        animals they infect. This could make them more susceptible to infection.
        It is even possible that, in space, pathogens may get better at causing
        disease. The Fruit Fly Lab-03 (FFL-03) mission will examine the combined
        effect of these changes during spaceflight. It will launch to the space
        station in April 2018.
